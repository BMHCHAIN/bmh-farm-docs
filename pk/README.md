### Ranking and Season Rewards <a href="#ranking-and-season-rewards" id="ranking-and-season-rewards"></a>

* Ranking System: Players which are able to earn ranking points are placed in the ranking table. The matchmaking system finds matches based on each player's ranking points.
* End-of-Season Rewards: Each season would provide rewards for all top-performing players, based on the total ranking points a player skilfully earns during that season. The first season lasts 3 months with a total initial competition prize pool of $1M, including ETH, XPET, and BPET. For the avoidance of doubt, ranking points are personal to the holder, non-transferrable, and not directly convertible into any money, stablecoin, digital asset, ETH, XPET or BPET. The rewards available to players would depend entirely on their performance during the season, which covers factors such as community voting/popularity, levels and variety of pets held, various in-game metrics such as time played, number of matches won, how efficiently matches are won, as well as offline metrics such as community involvement.
* The first season lasts 3 months with a total reward of $50,000, including ETH, XPET, and BPET. Additionally, the rewards may increase if the Volume for PvP increases.
* The rewards are distributed in 12 stages. The first 11 stages distribute 55% of the total prize (5% for each stage) and the final stage of the season distributes the remaining 45% of the prize. Every stage lasts 1 week.
