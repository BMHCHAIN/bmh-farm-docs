# Hero Saiyan training

Use POTION to train your Hero , the more you train it, the more Power it gets. For each POTION you use to train hero, you will receive 50 Power points

Training pets will give you an extremely high amount of Power and will help you be more competitive in each battle. For each POTION paid to train Hero on the interface, the user will send an order to the smart contract, and that smart contract will consume an amount of BPET equivalent to the number of POTIONs the user paid for training hero.
