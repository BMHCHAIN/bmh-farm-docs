## Weapons

There are four primary types of weapons: **Bow, Sword, Magic Wand, and Shield.** Each weapon type possesses unique characteristics, and they interact with each other in a counter system: Bows counter Swords, Swords counter Magic Wands, Magic Wands counter Shields, and Shields counter Bows.

### **Weapon System** <a href="#weapon-system" id="weapon-system"></a>

The equipment tiers include Wood, Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Ruby. The quality of the material used in crafting weapons directly influences the benefits provided to the player's hero. Higher-quality materials result in more significant advantages for the hero, enhancing their combat capabilities. Weapons when equipped on a hero will increase the hero's Power by a percentage.

|         | Bow  | Sword | Magic Wand | Shield |
| ------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Wood    | 10%  | 10%   | 10%        | 10%    |
| Iron    | 20%  | 20%   | 20%        | 20%    |
| Gold    | 30%  | 30%   | 30%        | 30%    |
| Diamond | 50%  | 50%   | 50%        | 50%    |
| Ruby    | 100% | 100%  | 100%       | 100%   |

### Crafting Weapons <a href="#crafting-weapons" id="crafting-weapons"></a>

Players must participate in both PvE and PvP modes to collect wooden weapon pieces. The player has accumulated enough wooden weapon pieces for a specific type of equipment, the system will automatically assemble them into a piece of complete equipment for the player.

| Weapon Type | Craft Ratio        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Wood        | 8 Wooden Fragments |
| Iron        | 10 Wooden Weapons  |
| Gold        | 15 Iron Weapons    |

Wooden weapons will automatically be upgraded into weapons with higher-quality materials at a certain rate. The automated upgrading system works as follows: Wooden fragments are combined into Wooden Weapons, Wooden Weapons are then upgraded to Iron Weapons, and Iron Weapons can further be upgraded to Gold Weapons.

1. Burn your Gold Weapons (go to your bag, right click your Golden Weapon and Burn it) to receive 0.25 x404 tokens (x404 is the ERC 404 standard).
2. When you accumulate 1 x404 token in your wallet, our contract will automatically mint a Diamond NFT Weapon (or maybe a Ruby Weapon) and send it to your wallet.
3. You can use this Diamond NFT Weapon in the game as a Diamond-tier weapon.

### Buy Golden Weapon  (BMH) <a href="#buy-golden-weapon" id="buy-golden-weapon"></a>

In addition to earning Golden Weapons by playing the game, players can also purchase these weapons using BPET in our store. Players will have to pay with BPET to buy these golden weapons. For every BPET you use to purchase weapons, we will forward that order directly to the BPET/x404 pool so that you can receive the corresponding amount of x404 tokens.

### NFT Weapons (Coming Soon) <a href="#nft-weapons-coming-soon" id="nft-weapons-coming-soon"></a>

The Diamond Weapon and Ruby Weapon form an NFT set with:

* Total supply: 40,000 NFTs.
* 95% are Diamond Weapons
* and 5% are Ruby Weapons.

Whenever a wallet accumulates 1 x404 token, the contract will automatically mint and send an NFT Weapon to that wallet. If the wallet transfers the x404 token, the NFT in the wallet will also be automatically burned. Therefore, it can be observed that obtaining Ruby Weapons is extremely challenging and they have a very high rarity.
