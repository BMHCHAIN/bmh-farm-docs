# ⚡ Energy

* Every time a player wins a PvP match, a corresponding amount of ENERGY is spent, equivalent to the Ranked Points earned in that particular match.
* Every day players will receive 50k⚡ energy.

**Note that:** When players run out of ENERGY, they are temporarily unable to participate in PvP matches. This happens because they have used up all their ENERGY in successful PvP battles. However, ENERGY will be fully refilled every 24 hours.
