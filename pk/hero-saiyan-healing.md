# Hero Saiyan Healing

During battles, your Hero may sustain injuries. If a hero is injured and unable to participate in battles, the player cannot engage in PvP until the hero is healed or replaced with another one.

* If you have needles in your bag, your hero will automatically use them for self-healing.
* In the absence of needles, the hero needs to rest for 3 days. After this period, the hero will naturally recover and be ready for the next battle.
* To expedite the healing process and avoid the 3-day rest, you can use POTION to heal the injured hero immediately. The cost per healing is equivalent to $0.3 (paid in POTION). For each POTION paid to heal the hero on the Saiyan interface, the user will send an order to the smart contract, and that smart contract will consume an amount of BPET equivalent to the number of POTIONs the user paid for healing the hero.
