#### The purpose of using Farm <a href="#the-purpose-of-using-farm" id="the-purpose-of-using-farm"></a>

* The farm is the place to take care of the user's hero and help him level up.
* With each completed farming cycle, the user will receive back the amount of BPet the user invested and a higher level for the user's hero.
* The farm allows the Hero to level up gradually and gives advantages in PvP and PvE (Adventure) modes. Users earn more BPet, and XPET from PvP and PvE.
