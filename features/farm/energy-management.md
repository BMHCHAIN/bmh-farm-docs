# ⬛ Energy Management

Each Saiyan Hero has an energy source, represented by hearts ranging from ❤️❤️❤️ to ❤️❤️❤️❤️

* Hero Rarity D; C; B => have 3 hearts.
* Hero Rarity A ⇒ has 4 hearts

✨ The rate at which a hero loses one heart depends on the hero's level, following a progressively increasing model. For example:

* At Level 1, depletes 1 ❤️ per hour;
* At Level 2, depletes 1 ❤️ every 2 hours; ... ;
* At Level n, depletes 1 ❤️ every n hours."

✨ **Farming:** From the moment a user starts farming until the hero runs out of energy. Once a hero is out of energy, they automatically stop farming:

✨ Only one Hero can be farmed at a time.

✨ After a Hero reaches a new level, their energy (hearts) will be fully restored

✨ Hero Saiyans stay stronger and longer using BPet to purchase essential Food.
