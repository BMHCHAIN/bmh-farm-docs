# â¬› Farm - The Training Grounds

This Farm feature serves as a dedicated space for Saiyan Heroes to work hard and earn XPET tokens.

Hero Saiyan needs to reach level 5 or higher to participate in the farm. The Farm will automatically generate an amount of $XPET, the player will receive an amount of BPet corresponding to the amount the user used to upgrade Saiyan. Earned BMH can be converted later into $XPET tokens for users.

For every time you upgrade a hero to a higher level, the Farm will automatically generate a certain amount of $BMH gradually over 25 days. After 25 days, you will receive $BMH equal to the amount you used to upgrade your Hero.

The farm can be claimed to your wallet every 10 minutes. After claiming, a cycle concludes, and you receive an amount of $XPET equivalent to what you initially invested to upgrade your heroand your hero is now at a higher level. If you continue to use the $BMH you just claimed to further upgrade your hero, you will start a new cycle.

Furthermore, joining the Farm ensures that the $BMH you spend is never lost and the funds you hold remain secure.
