### 1. Total Spending <a href="#id-1.-total-spending" id="id-1.-total-spending"></a>

All BPET spent by the user (including re-spent BMH ) will be counted towards 'Total Spend

Total spend is the total number of BMH you have spent to buy the hero, upgrade the hero and upgrade the factory. The user will receive 100% of the spending amount after 25days

_**Total Spending = BMH or $XPET used to buy hero + BMH used to Upgrade**_

### 2. Distributed and Remain <a href="#id-2.-distributed-and-remain" id="id-2.-distributed-and-remain"></a>

Distributed is the amount paid to the user

Remain is the remaining number of BPET that the user can continue to receive

_**Remain = Total Spending - Distributed**_

When users spend _**XPET**_ to upgrade, they receive a full refund along with a higher-level hero. This upgraded hero enhances their earnings in both PvE and PvP modes. The higher the hero's level, the greater the income boost.
