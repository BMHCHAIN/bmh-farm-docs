# ðŸªš PvE (Adventure)

Your Hero will not only operate on the farm; now, they can also go on adventures!

When you own a pet at level 10 or higher, you can participate in Adventure. Adventure is divided into three Zones, each corresponding to different areas where your hero can engage:

* **Zone 1:** Hero from Level 10 to Level 29 are eligible to participate.
* **Zone 2:** Hero at Level 30 or higher are eligible to participate.
* **Zone 3:** Only open during special events. ( Depending on each event.)

### **Rewards in Adventure** <a href="#rewards-in-adventure" id="rewards-in-adventure"></a>

The rewards in Adventure primarily consist of BPET. This BPET amount is derived from 10% of the total revenue generated from purchases in our store, Pet upgrades, and Factory upgrades from the previous day (refer to the User Rewards section for more details).

This 10% of total revenue in BPET is evenly distributed among the Zones in Adventure based on the proportion of players in each Zone, and their respective interactions and activities. The higher the level of the Hero, the more BPET it will be eligible to receive. Zone 2 will always have more rewards than Zone 1.

Additionally, there is a chance to receive `xEGG fragments` ranging from 1 to 5 stars when participating in Adventure. These xEGG fragments can be combined to create NFT xEGG ranging from 1 to 5 stars.

#### APY in PvE <a href="#apy-in-pve" id="apy-in-pve"></a>

In SAIYAN PvE mode, the reward pool for each zone is fixed and determined by the amount of platform revenue. When you engage in PvE, you will receive rewards based on the amount of BPET remaining in the farm mode. We base the distribution of rewards on this figure to ensure fair compensation for active participants.

This means that at any given moment, the APY of each PvE zone is fixed. As you upgrade your pets, spend more and have greater interactions with the system, the remaining BPET in your Farm increases, which leads to your BPET rewards increasing dramatically.

#### Zone 1 <a href="#zone-1-formula" id="zone-1-formula"></a>

1.  **Daily BPET Distribution**:

    * Formula:

    ![](https://chainkloud-coms-organization.gitbook.io/\~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1796548972-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZEMUFPTQrcf7O846fusu%252Fuploads%252FKHfAFbSUamdTTSYdgA8S%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D34bdaa6b-8ee8-4170-8edf-a6c56d4f7a33\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=ac82527fe4185029ed58b798d762e192355b2b4adc9966e42e3b51b796664fe1)

    * Explanation: This formula calculates the total BPET to be distributed daily across the entire system in Zone 1. Here, "totalRemain of the system" refers to the total number of remaining BPET in the Farm of the entire system. The formula takes 60% of this total and divides it by 365, distributing it evenly over a year.
2.  **BPET Received by Each User**:

    * Formula:

    ![](https://chainkloud-coms-organization.gitbook.io/\~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1796548972-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZEMUFPTQrcf7O846fusu%252Fuploads%252FMQdWrKeB9h3pDT2xjXQK%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7ee01ee6-76d5-4e73-9574-15f9b1fb903a\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=8a876b0834c35a972afe483f58cfdce9c5d72654f71feaffe9f3d37bc20c6998)

    * Explanation: This formula determines the amount of BPET each user receives daily. "Remain of user's wallet" refers to the number of remaining BPET in that user's Farm. The formula calculates each user's share of the daily distribution proportionally, based on their Farm's BPET compared to the total BPET remaining in the system.

#### Zone 2 <a href="#zone-2-formula" id="zone-2-formula"></a>

Similar to Zone 1, with a different percentage for the daily distribution:

1. **Daily BPET Distribution**:
   *   Formula:

       ![](https://chainkloud-coms-organization.gitbook.io/\~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1796548972-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZEMUFPTQrcf7O846fusu%252Fuploads%252FhA3WPHIQNVpPLJNmLDDk%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da50c2717-9aab-46b8-bc19-e63c0656a618\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=ff4f8a6c8d2e4bbb8968b73987364cf4495167168754085be0945526205d6540)
   * Explanation:In Zone 2, the daily distribution uses 65% of the system's total BPET remaining in the Farm, signifying a higher daily distribution rate than in Zone 1.
2. **BPET Received by Each User** remains the same as in Zone 1.

#### Zone 3 (Special Zone) <a href="#zone-3-special-zone-formula" id="zone-3-special-zone-formula"></a>

A significantly higher percentage for the daily distribution:

1. **Daily BPET Distribution**:
   *   Formula:

       ![](https://chainkloud-coms-organization.gitbook.io/\~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1796548972-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FZEMUFPTQrcf7O846fusu%252Fuploads%252FzUASKnLMAC734FAqXd15%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2cc52d3e-06a6-4e71-89f2-c3424d637ff7\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=7de153a21bacb8de9cee148df7e7ca660d2f203599b0cbf3a62a3fb84e6e157e)
   * Explanation: Zone 3 uses 180% for the daily distribution calculation, indicating a substantially larger amount of BPET is distributed daily compared to Zones 1 and 2.
2. **BPET Received by Each User** is calculated the same way as in Zones 1 and 2.

#### Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

* The "Daily BPET Distribution" in each zone is determined by a specified percentage of the total remaining BPET in the Farm of the system, divided over a year.
* "BPET Received by Each User" is calculated based on the proportion of their Farm's remaining BPET compared to the total BPET remaining in the system.
* The percentage used for daily distribution varies across zones, reflecting different distribution rates of BPET in each zone.
