# 🏪 Market

The XSaiyan Market is used as a place where users can buy and sell Saiyans, or upgrade items.

Go to the Market tab ==> Click \[Buy Pack] ==> Each Pack will randomly present the rarity of the Saiyan. The Hero level is determined by the level of the Pack, and users will receive Saiyans with random rarity (Rarity distributed from D; C; B; A).

#### **FEE**: <a href="#fee" id="fee"></a>

When installing Saiyan on the browser, users will need a certain amount of MIX (on the Miexs chain) for the following purposes:

* Transaction fees
* Buy and upgrade Heroes
* Buy and sell food for Hero

For each successful transaction that takes place within the Market, a nominal **transaction fee of 0.5%** is collected. This fee is a crucial source of revenue for the Saiyan project.

The collected fees are strategically accumulated in a dedicated reward fund.
